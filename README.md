# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using machine learning, based on property features such as size, number of bedrooms, and location.

## Project Overview

The objective is to build a regression model to estimate house prices. It involves:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and transformation
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualizing predicted vs actual prices

## Files

- `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all steps from preprocessing to model evaluation
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, TensorFlow / Keras

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the notebook:
   Open `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

## Model Evaluation

- Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Visual comparisons of predicted vs actual prices
